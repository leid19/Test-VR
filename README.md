# Viewstamped Replication (VR) Simulation

This project demonstrates the **Viewstamped Replication (VR)** protocol, including its three major sub-protocols:

1. **Normal Operation Protocol**
2. **View Change Protocol**
3. **Replica Recovery Protocol**

Each node runs independently as a replica (primary or backup).  
The system ensures consistent replication and fault tolerance through view changes and recovery.

### Step 1: Open 4 Terminal Windows

#### Terminal 1 - Start Node 0
```bash
cd E:\5567-Lab-3
python vr_node.py --id 0 --port 6000 --peer_ports 6000,6001,6002,6003

```
You will see:
``` bath
âœ“ Node 0 started at port 6000
[node0 P view=0] >>>
```
